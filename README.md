Forecasting Employee Attrition Using Work Condition Features

Employee attrition can profoundly affect businesses, with short and long-term repercussions. It incurs costs, dampens morale, hampers operational efficiency, and undermines long-term competitiveness. This research seeks to develop an employe attrition prediction model.

In this project, I developed six models—Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbor, Random Forest, and Ensemble modeling—to predict employee attrition with over 92% accuracy. Performance was evaluated using accuracy and F1-score metrics.
